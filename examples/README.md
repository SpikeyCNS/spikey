# Spikey Examples

The Spikey examples provide a concise, linear method of understanding the
spiking neural network framework and training platform. The ideal order
of content is as follows,

**1. Tutorials: Teach the fundamentals of the simulator.**

    * **tutorial.ipynb**: A quick overview of the core spiking neural network framework and training platform.

**2. How-to Guides: Guides on how to create specific experiments.**
    * izhikevich2007.ipynb: Recreation of Izhikevich's 2007 paper,
    "Solving the Distal Reward Problem through linkage of STDP and Dopamine Signaling".
    * florian2007.ipynb: Recreation of Florian's 2007 paper,
    "Reinforcement Learning Through Modulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity".

**3. Reference: Material and baselines to get running quickly.**
    * run_series, series_analysis.ipynb: Bootstrap code to run a series of experiments and analyze them.
    * run_meta, meta_analysis.ipynb: Bootstrap code to perform a hyperparameter search and analyze results.
