# Spiking Neural Network Framework

SNN/ contains the core spiking neural network framework. This includes each piece of a network: neuron, synapse, ... There are multiple pre-built implementations for each part as well the power to template and customize them all. Though each can be used and interacted with individually, the Network(, RLNetwork, ContinousRLNetwork) object serves as a manager and neat interface for the whole spiking neural network with all of its parts.
