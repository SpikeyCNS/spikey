# Viz tools

A small set of pre-built visualization and analysis functions exist here in
_spikey/viz_.
Jupyter notebooks containing even more tools also exist in this repo,
examples/meta_analysis.ipynb.
If you have made a custom visualization that would be helpful to
others, please submit a feature pull request!
